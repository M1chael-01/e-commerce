📁 Project Structure
This project was bootstrapped with React and is split into two main parts:

🔙 Backend (/server)
Built with Node.js and Express

Handles API routes, Stripe payments, and PostgreSQL database

Location: server/

🔜 Frontend (/client)
Built with React.js

Manages UI, product pages, cart, and Stripe checkout

Location: server/client/

⚠️ Important Notes
Frontend and backend are separate — run both servers for full functionality.

Errors like loading issues or failed API calls may occur if the backend isn’t running.

The frontend is inside the server/ folder — double-check your paths.
